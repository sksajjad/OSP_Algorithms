1. CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
   1. FCFS (First Come First Serve).c
   2. SJF (Short Job First) - Not Preemptive.c
   3. SJF (Short Job First) - Not Preemptive.c
   4. Round Robin (Not Arrival).c
   5. Round Robin (Arrival).c
3. DeadLock Avoiding Algorithm:
   1. Banker's Algorithm
4. Page Replacement Algorithm:
   1. FIFO (First In First Out).c
   2. LRU (Least Recently Used).c
   3. Optimal.c
5. [NOTE]: "sortSearch.h" is a header file used in "SJF (Short Job First) - Preemptive.c".
